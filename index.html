    <h2>How We Use Meta Platform Data</h2>
    <p>
      Our platform only uses Meta Platform Data for Facebook and Instagram accounts that clients
      explicitly connect to Linkalls. We use this data only to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create, schedule and publish posts on behalf of our clients to their connected pages and accounts.</li>
      <li>Show basic performance metrics of posts inside the client dashboard (planned feature).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not sell, rent or share Meta Platform Data with third parties, and we do not use it for our
      own marketing or profiling. Clients can disconnect their accounts at any time, after which we revoke
      our API access.
